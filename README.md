## Introduction

I was wondering if a Penrose triangle could be made into a 3-d model. I thought not but webbed on
over to sketchfab and did a quick search and found the wonderful work of [Michael Ostroff](https://sketchfab.com/MichaelOstroff)

## Threlte source code

You are free to copy and use this threlte code. This was a learning experience for me. At first after I loaded the model, it wouldn't show up - all black. So after some reading about Environments, I used an image from a previous project and Voila! the model showed up. More to come!

This project uses threlte, tailwindcss, postcss and threejs. You may view the results here.
